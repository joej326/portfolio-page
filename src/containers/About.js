            <p>
               Learning and teaching are probably my two
               favorite things in the whole world. <br />
                I also love having deep conversations with people. <br />
               If you love philosophy like I do,
               we could probably talk for hours on end. <br />
               (If you don't like philosophy, don't get me started! I may bore you with my deep thoughts!) <br />
               <br />

               In my freetime you will probably find me reading,
              rollerblading/longboarding, gaming, or of course: <span>coding</span>.
